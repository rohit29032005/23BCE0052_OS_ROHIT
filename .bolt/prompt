This project is a visual simulator for the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm used in
operating systems. 🚀 It allows users to input process allocation, maximum resource needs, and
available resources, then visualizes the algorithm's execution to determine if the system is in a safe
state. This tool is designed for educational purposes, helping students and professionals understand
the Banker's Algorithm through interactive simulation.
